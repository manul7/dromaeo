= Why?
I was need to use SQLite3 database as mobile storage for test results.
So I've added db.ini file and updated store.php to have single tree for 
benchmark, but with capability to select where to store the results.

== How to use
# Install Dromaeo as usual
# Create a database with corresponding SQL query 
# Go to web/db.ini and comment/uncomment required settings, save changes

Now it's ready.
